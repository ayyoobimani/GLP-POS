Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging is an important component of the NLP pipeline, but many low-resource languages lack labeled data for training. An established method for training a POS tagger in such a scenario is to create a labeled training set by transferring from high-resource languages. 
This repository contains the code, data, and trained models for the paper [Graph-Based Multilingual Label Propagation for Low-Resource Part-of-Speech Tagging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09840).
The paper proposes a novel method for transferring labels from multiple high-resource source to low-resource target languages. We formalize POS tag projection as graph-based label propagation. Given translations of a sentence in multiple languages, we create a graph with words as nodes and alignment links as edges by aligning words for all language pairs. We then propagate node labels from source to target using a Graph Neural Network augmented with transformer layers. We show that our propagation creates training sets that allow us to train POS taggers for a diverse set of languages. When combined with enhanced contextualized embeddings, our method achieves a new state-of-the-art for unsupervised POS tagging of low resource languages.


Reproduce the results in the paper
---------
If you only intend to reproduce the final results download the trained models from [our website](http://cistern.cis.lmu.de/glp_pos/) and use the [predict.py file](https://github.com/ayyoobimani/GLP-POS/blob/main/predict.py) to run them. 

`python3 predict.py --gpu 0 --model model_path --test test_path`

The ground truth files used in our paper are available in [TEST directory](https://github.com/ayyoobimani/GLP-POS/tree/main/TEST). These files come from the [Universal Dependencies project](https://universaldependencies.org/), modified as described in our paper to accomodate the multiword tokens problem.


Train Part-of-Speech taggers using our generated data
----------
Use [train_pos_tagger.py](https://github.com/ayyoobimani/GLP-POS/blob/main/train_pos_tagger.py) file to train POS taggers for different languages.
The training data generated by our GLP models are available in [GLP1](https://github.com/ayyoobimani/GLP-POS/tree/main/GLP1) and [GLP2](https://github.com/ayyoobimani/GLP-POS/tree/main/GLP2) directories.


The code is Tested with Python 3.6, Transformers 4.15.0, Torch 1.10.1.

Install Flair with its dependencies (see [their repo](https://github.com/flairNLP/flair)):

`pip install flair`

Download our modified version of Flair and substitute the orginal Flair folder with ours.


Train POS model example:

`python3 train_pos_tagger.py --lang por --gpu 5 --train train_file.connlu --test test_file.conllu --epochs 30`

Prediction and evaluation of POS model example:
